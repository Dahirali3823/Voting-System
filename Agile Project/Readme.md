The Project we built is a voting software system developed that allows users to run three different types of elections
Instant runoff voting (IRV) , Closed Party Listing (CPL) and Popularity Only(PO)

# Current Issue:
  - When running multiple files, duplicate results are be produced for the first file selected
  
# How to run the Project: 

  -  Make sure you are in the correct directory which is ```java``` in Project 2 
   
  -  If not type ```cd src/main/java``` then hit ENTER
	 
  -  Type the command  ```javac ElectionProcessor.java```
   
  -  Then Type the command ```java ElectionProcessor```
   
    
An InterFace should pop up saying Election File Reader and select the files in the ```java``` folder you want to run. Select the file you want to run making sure its a ```.csv``` file then click Open. If you want to run multiple files, After you click the first file, click the ```Select files``` button and choose the csv files as needed.Make sure you select a file of one type such as ```IRTest.csv```, otherwise it will show an error and make you remove the files of the type you donâ€™t want to run.

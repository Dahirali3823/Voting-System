The Project we built is a voting software system developed that allows users to run different type of elections.
# WaterFall Project

The ```Waterfall project``` folder is the initial voting system built that runs through the command line and runs ```Instant Runoff (IR)``` and ```Closed Party Listing (CPL)``` voting . We built it using the Waterfall method and  worked on  making a ```Software design document(SDD)``` and a ```Software requirement rpecifications document (SRS)``` and then building our project from those requirements, documenting it  and testing it

# Agile Project

The ```Agile project``` folder contains the extentsion of the waterfall project that was built using the using the agile scrum method. Over a two week sprint, we built a voting system that uses a GUI to run ballot files and is able to run not only ```Instant Runoff Voting(IR)``` and ```Closed Party Listing (CPL)``` but also ``` Popularity only (PO)``` voting too. The system is also able to run multiple files of the same type at once and produce a audit file containing election information about the process
